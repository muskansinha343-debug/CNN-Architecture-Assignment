        "\n",
        "In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), filters (also called kernels) and feature maps play a crucial role in extracting important information from an input image.\n",
        "\n",
        "A filter is a small matrix of numbers (for example, 3×3 or 5×5) that slides over the input image. Its purpose is to detect specific visual patterns such as edges, corners, textures, or shapes. During convolution, the filter performs element-wise multiplication with a portion of the image and sums the result to produce a single value. This process is repeated across the entire image. Each filter is trained to recognize a particular type of feature, such as vertical edges, horizontal lines, or curves.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a filter is applied to the image, it produces a feature map. A feature map is the output matrix that shows where a particular feature is present in the image and how strongly it appears. Bright or high-value areas in a feature map indicate strong detection of that feature, while low values indicate weak or no detection. If multiple filters are used, multiple feature maps are created, each representing a different type of detected feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, filters and feature maps enable CNNs to learn hierarchical patterns in data. In the early layers, filters detect simple features like edges and textures. In deeper layers, they combine these simple features to detect more complex patterns such as objects or faces. Thus, filters act as feature detectors, and feature maps store the extracted information that allows the CNN to understand and classify images effectively."
